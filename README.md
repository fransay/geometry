# Geometry [aL]
> Geometry is one of the oldest branch of mathematics concerned 
> with the properties of space that are related to distance
> shape, size and relative position of figures.
> Geometry takes its name from the greek belief that
geometry began with Egyptian surveyors of two or three
> millennia ago measuring the Earth, or at least the fertile expanse of it that was annually flooded
by the Nile.
## Objects In Geometry
**Points** : Points are fundamental for building geometry. Every geometric shape is defined as a set of points
; this is not the case in synthetic geometry, where a line is another fundamental object that is not viewed as the set of the points through which it passes!
, points are primal in geometric objects.

**Line Segment** : A line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points, and contains every point on the line that is between its endpoints

**Linestring** : A linestring is a one-dimensional object representing a sequence of points
and the line segment connecting them.

**LinearRing** :A linearRing is a linestring which is both simple and closed. It is a list of points in a ring. 
this means the first point is the last point.

**Polygon** : A polygon is a plane figure, that is described by a finite number of straight line segment connected to form a close polygonal chain.
The bounded plane region maybe called a polygon. The segments of a polygonal circuits are called the edges or the sides. 
The points where two edges meet are called the polygon vertices.
