# Geometry [aL]
> Geometry is one of the oldest branch of mathematics concerned 
> with the properties of space that are related to distance
> shape, size and relative position of figures.
> Geometry takes its name from the greek belief that
geometry began with Egyptian surveyors of two or three
> millennia ago measuring the Earth, or at least the fertile expanse of it that was annually flooded
by the Nile.
## objects in geometry
**points** : points are fundamental for building geometry. Every geometric shape is defined as a set of points
; this is not the case in synthetic geometry, where a line is another fundamental object that is not viewed as the set of the points through which it passes!
, points are primal in geometric objects.

**line segment** : A line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points, and contains every point on the line that is between its endpoints

**linestring** : A linestring is a one-dimensional object representing a sequence of points
and the line segment connecting them.

**linearRing** : linearRing is a linestring which is both simple and closed
